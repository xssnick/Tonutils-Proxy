#### Usage
Connect it as native library to you app, and use available methods:
```c
extern char* StartProxy(unsigned short port);
extern char* StartProxyWithConfig(unsigned short port, char* configTextJSON);
extern char* StopProxy();
```
`StartProxy` will run local http proxy server on `127.0.0.1:port`. 
Use this server as http proxy in your webview component or in any other way.

# How to use

## GUI
#### Start it
Click big blue button, it will configure your system automatically and open foundation.ton.

##### If TON sites not opens
If for some reason your system was not autoconfigured or you don't want to reconfigure it, you can enter HTTP proxy address manually in your browser. Follow CLI instructions starting from [section 2](#2-connect-your-browser-to-it). 

HTTP proxy uses `127.0.0.1:8080` address.

## CLI
##### 1. Open it
Double click on it on windows, or run it using terminal on linux/mac.

HTTP proxy will start on `127.0.0.1:8080` address.
